	<h1>About this app</h1>

	<p>
		This is a <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev">SvelteKit</a> app. You can make your own by typing the
		following into your command line and following the prompts:
	</p>

	<pre>npm create svelte@latest</pre>

	<p>
		The page you're looking at is purely static HTML, with no client-side interactivity needed.
		Because of that, we don't need to load any JavaScript. Try viewing the page's source, or opening
		the devtools network panel and reloading.
	</p>

	<p>
		The <a href="/sverdle">Sverdle</a> page illustrates SvelteKit's data loading and form handling. Try
		using it with JavaScript disabled!
	</p>
